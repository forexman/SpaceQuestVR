# SpaceQuestVR
A simple space shooter prototype for Meta Quest using Unity and its XR Interaction Toolkit.

You are the last defender of Exalis Base, located on the third moon of Xendor. Above you is the connection of the Etheirys and Andromeda Hyperspace lanes, and the best part to ambush the invading forces of the Daxxan Empire.

Are you up for the task?
